# Language parser

This project was a school project and so has MANY problems:
- It's all in french,
- The code is really badly indented and probably not well written,

## TODO

Because there is a lot to do here...
- Rewrite everything in english
- Clean the code
- Make sure the program can parse any "home made" language, as long
	as a language description is provided. Probably adapters will be needed.
